# Adafruit Eye Display

This project is to create an eye that moves around on the "Adafruit Round RGB TTL TFT Display - 2.1" 480x480 No Touchscreen" using the "Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3" for the microcontroller.

## Progress
All I have right now is an ellipse that blinks.


I don't know how to complete this project since this stuff is new to me, but I will do my best.
